### Hi, I'm Jonathan

I am in the process of moving back to Github for my personal projects such as my
[blog](https://jonathanbartlett.co.uk) and my [dotfiles](https://github.com/Jonnobrow/dotfiles).

My university work and a lot of other stuff still lives at [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/Jonnobrow/).

- ðŸ’»**Right now**: I'm just updating my personal dotfiles and adding to my server whilst I tutor Computer Science
- ðŸ“… **Next**: I will be starting at [Sky](https://sky.com) in October 2021.

More from me:
- [My Landing Page ðŸ›¬ and Blog ðŸ“”](https://jonathanbartlett.co.uk)
- [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/jsb1g18)
