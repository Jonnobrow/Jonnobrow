### Hi, I'm Jonathan

I am in the process of moving back to Github for my personal projects such as my
[blog](https://blog.jonnobrow.co.uk) and my [dotfiles](https://github.com/Jonnobrow/dotfiles).

My university work and a lot of other stuff still lives at [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/Jonnobrow/).

- 💻**Right now**: I'm just updating my personal dotfiles while I finish my Computer Science degree
- 📅 **Next**: I am going to revisit some abandoned projects during my loooong summer break
- 🚀 **In the future**: I will be starting at [Sky](https://sky.com) in October 2021.


More from me:
- [My Landing Page 🛬](https://jonnobrow.co.uk/)
- [My Blog 📔](https://blog.jonnobrow.co.uk/), it's baron right now but more *coming soon*™️
